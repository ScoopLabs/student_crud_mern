  ==========================================
    App Layout Component (Root of Routes)
  ==========================================
  - This is the main layout component for our app.
  - It is loaded at the root path ("/") by React Router.
  - The <Outlet /> acts like a "placeholder" where
    child routes (StudentList, CreateStudent, EditStudent) 
    will be rendered.
  - App.css provides global styling for this layout.
